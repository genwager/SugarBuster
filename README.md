# Sugar Buster

As of 2021, 38.4 million people in the United States had a diabetes diagnosis [1]. 

For patients with diabetes, sugar cravings can appear when 
1) blood glucose is too low,
2) too high, or 
3) for no apparent reason. 

The incidence of diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate in the United States [1]. The goal of this project is create a therapeutic device to relieve sugar cravings in the moment and reduce symptoms of diabetes. 


## Description

SugarBuster works to elicit sweetness through a combination of visual, tactile, and thermal stimulation. A literature review of research devices designed to evoke taste revealed thermal stimulation has the highest likelihood of eliciting a sensation of sweetness. Investigation of electrical stimulation found no effect on perceived sweetness regardless of parametrization around stimulation frequency [2]. In conjunction, the rounded shape, the color red, and stickiness have an association and possibly assist in the cross-modal communication that elicits sweetness. The incorporation of a material that mimics stickiness may also aid our goal as stickiness is a common tactile feature with a strong, direct, relationship to sweetness [1]. Conversation with potential users allowed us to refine the physical size, shape, and material constraints of our device. Based on feedback from our target market, the design must be small in size (e.g. lollipop) and spherical in shape to maximize comfort and discretion of use. The combination of several sensory systems and sugar-associated cues, maximizes the opportunity for this deviceâ€™s success. 
While the method to evoke a sense of sweetness and basic design constraints is identified, uncertainty if the simulation of sweetness will reduce sugar cravings remains. The underlying electrophysiology of taste sensation and the relationship between glucose concentration and sugar craving is not entirely developed. Researchers have identified food cravings appearing at hyperglycemic levels and sugar cravings appearing at hypoglycemic levels [5, 6]. Using relationships like the Nernst equation (E = Eo-RTFzln([x]o[x]e)) that describes cellular charge and setpoint values of glucose concentration that induced cravings, a mathematical model may be developed that allows our team to intervene both therapeutically and effectively [7]. To accomplish our goal of creating a therapeutic device that relieves sugar cravings in real time and reduces the symptoms of diabetes we have converged on the stimulation method and design, but must develop a stronger conceptual/pathophysiological understanding of our target.
